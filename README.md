## Copy of Setup Instructions

Participants should have a recent version of Node.js installed on their system (preferably the latest LTS version, which is 6.9.1 as of this writingâ€”but anything from 0.10 on should work). Participants should clone the following repositories and run `npm install` in each of them prior to the start of the workshop.

Optional: It might be helpful to install Electron globally so that you can use it from the command line in case there are any issues with any of the dependencies in the project above. You can install this through `npm install -g electron`.

Finally, debugging the main process is easiest using Visual Studio Code, which is available for all platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). This is not a hard requirement, but helpful if you'd like to follow along for that small segment of the workshop.
